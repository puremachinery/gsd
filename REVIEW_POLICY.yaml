# REVIEW_POLICY.yaml
# Drop this file in your repo root to guide AI agents on targeted code reviews.
# Instead of "review this", agents should perform each enabled review type separately.

version: "1.1"

# Global defaults (can be overridden per review type)
defaults:
  enabled: true
  frequency: "every_pr"  # every_pr | daily | weekly | monthly | quarterly | manual
  severity: "medium"     # low | medium | high | critical

# ============================================================================
# CONDITION LOGIC
# ============================================================================
# skip_if:  List of project flags. Review is SKIPPED if ANY flag matches (OR).
# only_if:  List of project flags. Review RUNS only if ANY flag matches (OR).
#
# For AND semantics (all flags must match), use:
#   skip_if_all: [...]   - skip only when ALL listed flags are set
#   only_if_all: [...]   - run only when ALL listed flags are set
#
# change_triggers: List of file glob patterns. For PR reviews, the review is
#   skipped if no changed files match any pattern. Ignored for periodic reviews.
#
# Evaluation order:
#   1. enabled: false → skip (hard override, nothing else checked)
#   2. postponements → skip if current date < until
#   3. skip_if / skip_if_all → skip if condition met
#   4. only_if / only_if_all → skip if condition NOT met
#   5. change_triggers → skip if PR review and no changed files match
#   6. frequency → skip if not yet due based on last_run

# ============================================================================
# SCOPE
# ============================================================================
# Controls what files the agent examines depending on review context.
scope:
  pr_review: "diff_and_imports"     # Changed files + files that directly import/depend on them
  periodic_review: "full"           # Entire codebase
  max_files_per_pass: 50            # Safety limit to bound token usage per review pass

# ============================================================================
# AGENT INSTRUCTIONS
# ============================================================================
agent_instructions: |
  When asked to "review" this codebase or a PR:

  1. Parse this REVIEW_POLICY.yaml file first
  2. Load .review_state.yaml to check last run times and current git ref
  3. Evaluate which reviews are due using this order for each review type:
     a. enabled: false → skip immediately
     b. Check postponements → skip if current date < until
     c. Check skip_if (OR: skip if ANY flag matches) / skip_if_all (AND: skip if ALL match)
     d. Check only_if (OR: run if ANY flag matches) / only_if_all (AND: run if ALL match)
     e. Check change_triggers (PR reviews only): skip if no changed files match any glob
     f. Check frequency: compare last_run against current time
        - "every_pr" reviews always run on PR/diff reviews or when code changed since last_ref
  4. Check project_flags to determine which skip_if/only_if conditions apply
  5. Check postponements for temporarily disabled reviews
  6. Determine scope based on review context:
     - PR reviews: examine changed files and their direct dependents (importers/callers)
       per the scope.pr_review setting
     - Periodic reviews (daily/weekly/monthly/quarterly): scan the full codebase
       per the scope.periodic_review setting
     - Respect scope.max_files_per_pass to bound token usage
  7. Batch reviews by category:
     - Run all due subcategories within a category (e.g. all correctness.* checks)
       in a SINGLE pass over the relevant files
     - Report and track findings SEPARATELY per subcategory
     - Do NOT combine reviews across different categories into one pass
  8. Prioritize categories by highest severity among their due subcategories:
     critical > high > medium > low
  9. After completing reviews:
     a. UPDATE .review_state.yaml with entries for each completed review:
        - last_run: current ISO timestamp
        - last_ref: current git HEAD short SHA
        - status: pass | warn | fail | skipped
        - findings_count: number of issues found
        - critical_count: number of critical/blocking issues
        - notes: brief summary if useful
     b. WRITE full output to .review_history/{review_type}/{timestamp}_{short_sha}.md
     c. PRUNE old history files per history_retention settings

  On-demand invocation:
  - To run ALL due reviews: "Review this codebase using REVIEW_POLICY.yaml"
  - To run a specific review: "Review security.secrets using REVIEW_POLICY.yaml"
  - To run a category: "Review all security reviews using REVIEW_POLICY.yaml"
  - On-demand requests bypass frequency checks (always run) but still respect
    enabled, skip_if, only_if, and change_triggers

  History file format (.review_history/{category}.{subcategory}/{timestamp}_{sha}.md):
    ```
    # {category}.{subcategory} Review

    **Date:** {ISO timestamp}
    **Git Ref:** {full sha}
    **Status:** PASS | WARN | FAIL
    **Findings:** {count} ({critical_count} critical)

    ## Summary
    {brief summary}

    ## Findings
    - [{SEVERITY}] `file:line` - description
    - [{SEVERITY}] `file:line` - description

    ## Files Reviewed
    - path/to/file.ext
    ```

    Severity labels for individual findings: [CRITICAL], [HIGH], [MEDIUM], [LOW]
    Use the review type's configured severity as the default, but override per
    finding when the actual impact differs.

  History pruning (run after each review):
    1. List files in .review_history/{review_type}/
    2. Sort by timestamp in filename to determine age/order
    3. Delete files where count exceeds max_per_type (keep newest N)
    4. Delete remaining files where age exceeds max_age_days

  Frequency interpretation:
  - every_pr: Run on any PR review or when code changed since last_ref
  - daily: Run if last_run > 24 hours ago
  - weekly: Run if last_run > 7 days ago
  - monthly: Run if last_run > 30 days ago
  - quarterly: Run if last_run > 90 days ago
  - manual: Only run when explicitly requested by name

  Consulting history:
  - When reviewing, you may read recent history files to see patterns
  - Recurring issues across multiple reviews may warrant higher severity
  - Resolved issues from prior reviews can be noted as fixed

  change_triggers evaluation:
  - Only applies to PR / diff reviews (not periodic)
  - Glob patterns are matched against the list of changed files in the PR
  - If change_triggers is present and NO changed files match, skip the review
  - If change_triggers is absent, the review is not filtered by file paths
  - Patterns follow standard glob syntax (**, *, ?)
